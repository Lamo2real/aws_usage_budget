# aws_usage_budget
Used this is where I configure the budget for my monthly usage of all AWS Services 


## Modification Execution

### there are two modules, one for Budget & one for Monthly costs such as services leveraged during the past month

#### when modifying the monthly cost you need to be in the /monthly_cost directory to apply changes or addition, same goes for /budget_config because they are two different modules as previously mentioned
